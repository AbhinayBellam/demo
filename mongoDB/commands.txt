To create Database or use database :
 >> use db_name;
 >> use basic;
Remember: In MongoDB, a database is not actually created until it gets content!

To create collection in database :
 1) >> db.createCollection("Col_name");
    >> db.createCollection("student");
 2) >> db.collectionName.insertOne({object});  object = document
    >> db.student.insertOne({name:"abhinay", age:"22"});
Remember: In MongoDB, a collection is not actually created until it gets content!

To create documents in database:
 1) >> db.student.insertOne({
       name:"abhinay",
       age:"22",
       gender:"male",
       })
 2) >> db.student.insertMany(
     {
       name:"abhinay",
       age:"22",
       gender:"male",
     },
     {
       name:"samba",
       age:"25",
       gender:"male",
     }
    )
Note: If you try to insert documents into a collection that does not exist, MongoDB will create the collection automatically.
